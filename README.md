# go-negentropy

## Main Idea

This is an implementation of Range-Based-Set-Reconciliation. It's basically a binary search set-reconciliation algorithm. You can read about the details [here](https://logperiodic.com/rbsr.html). This code is basically a re-implementation of [Doug Hoyte's repository here](https://github.com/hoytech/negentropy).

We have integrated our code into the test suite in that repo, and it passes all tests. We will make a PR to that repo to add our test harness to it.
